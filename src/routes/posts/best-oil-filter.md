An oil change is more than just about the oil; it's also about the filter that keeps that oil clean. You've probably already figured out what oil you're going to use, but have you given any thought to the filter? That's where things get complicated. We conducted a rigorous test to determine the best high-mileage oil filter for your vehicle, leaving no stone unturned. Here's what we found.
The Contenders

We tested four popular oil filters: Mobil 1 Extended Performance, FRAM Ultra Synthetic, K&N Select, and Walmart's Premium SuperTech. Each of these claims to offer protection for up to 20,000 miles. Impressive as that sounds, we wanted to know how these filters actually perform under various testing conditions.

## Test 1: Restrictiveness

Oil filters have one job: to remove contaminants and impurities from the oil, allowing the engine to run smoothly. However, the effectiveness of a filter often comes at the cost of flow restriction. So, our first test was aimed at gauging this restrictiveness.

The Mobil 1 filter showed 21.1 PSI on our pressure gauge, followed by Walmart's SuperTech at 22.2 PSI. Surprisingly, the FRAM Ultra Synthetic came in at a higher 24 PSI, indicating more restrictiveness. K&N Select slightly lagged behind Mobil 1.

## Test 2: Filtering Capacity

Our next test involved measuring the filter's capacity to hold contaminants. We used 30-micron aluminum powder for this test, a common size for most contaminants these filters claim to eliminate.

The FRAM Ultra Synthetic held an impressive 50 grams of aluminum powder, while Mobil 1 wasn't far behind at 48 grams. Walmart’s Premium SuperTech and K&N both held around 25 grams, significantly lower than the frontrunners.

## Test 3: Build Quality

Upon dismantling the filters, we found that Mobil 1’s design appears to be the superior one, focusing on collecting impurities in its filter pleats rather than interfering with the drain-back valve like the FRAM Ultra Synthetic. K&N and Walmart's SuperTech had similar build quality but with certain limitations, such as unevenly distributed filter pleats.

## Test 4: Laboratory Analysis

Lastly, we sent the used oil samples to an oil testing laboratory. The K&N filter reduced wear metal particles to just 34 parts per million, outperforming all others. Mobil 1 and Walmart's SuperTech tied at 40 parts per million, while FRAM was at 37.

## The Verdict

After crunching the numbers, Mobil 1 comes out on top, offering exceptional build quality and filtering capacity, along with the least amount of flow restriction. The FRAM Ultra Synthetic and the K&N tied for second place.

## The Takeaway

Choosing the right oil filter involves finding a balance between filtering capacity and restrictiveness. If performance and efficiency are your priority, you might opt for Mobil 1 or K&N. For those more concerned about maximum filtering, FRAM could be your go-to, although Mobil 1 seems to offer the best of both worlds.

Remember, the best filter for you will ultimately depend on your specific needs and what you prioritize more: engine efficiency or contaminant removal.
